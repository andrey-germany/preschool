## 🎯 The Three Pedagogical Frameworks

### Jean Piaget (Cognitive Development)
- **Key Age 3-6**: Preoperational stage (symbolic play, perception-based)
- **Apply**: Use colors, characters, magic, animations
- **Games**: Alphabet, Color Sorting, Shape Explorer, Counting

### Maria Montessori (Prepared Environment)
- **Key Principle**: Child-directed, sensorial, hands-on
- **Apply**: Large touch targets, multi-sensory input, free choice
- **Games**: All games, especially Color Sorting, Sequence Builder

### Modern Learning Science
- **Key Principle**: Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness (Self-Determination)
- **Apply**: Free game choice, progressive difficulty, leaderboards
- **Games**: All games, multiplayer sessions, achievements

#### 2.3 Sequence & Pattern Building
- **What**: Arrange items in order (size, color, number)
- **Why**: Seriation is key emerging Piaget operation
- **Age**: 4-6
- **Time**: 3-4 hours

#### 2.4 Syllable Clapping
- **What**: Tap/clap for each syllable heard (multi-modal)

- **Age**: 3-5
- **Time**: 3-4 hours

#### 2.5 Shape Explorer
- **What**: Match shapes, fit in outlines, progressive difficulty
- **Why**: Spatial reasoning + visual discrimination
- **Age**: 3-5
- **Time**: 3-4 hours

#### 2.6 Counting Adventure
- **What**: Count, tap, voice, or type to target number
- **Why**: Number sense foundation (Montessori Golden Beads equivalent)
- **Age**: 3-5
- **Time**: 3-4 hours
